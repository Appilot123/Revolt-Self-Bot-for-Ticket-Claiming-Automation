## Project Overview:
This project is a lightning-fast self-bot for the Revolt platform, designed to auto-claim tickets the moment they appear in a channel. Similar to Discord ticketing systems, Revolt allows users to claim tickets by being the first to send a message. In competitive environments where milliseconds matter, this bot is engineered to win the raceâ€”leveraging low-latency websockets, instant message dispatching, and highly optimized runtime execution.


## Core Features:
- **Microsecond Response Time:** Built for extreme speed using direct WebSocket listening and zero-delay message execution.
- **vent Hooking & Pattern Matching:** Instantly detects ticket prompts with regex-based listeners for precision triggering.
- **Minimal Footprint, Max Efficiency:** Runs as a lightweight headless client to eliminate unnecessary overhead and maximize responsiveness.

## Features List:

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-Time Ticket Detection**  | Listens directly to Revoltâ€™s websocket events to detect ticket prompts.            |
| **Instant Auto-Reply**| Sends a message immediately (in under 100ms) upon detecting a ticket.                        |
| **Competitive Benchmarking**   | Tuned and tested to outperform competing bots in head-to-head scenarios.            |
| **Fail-Safe Mode**         | Retries once if initial send fails or is rate-limited.                                  |
| **Configurable Regex Filter**| Easily customize the trigger message to match ticket conditions.                      |
| **Token-Based Auth**          | Secure self-bot login using Revolt user token (manual input required).               |

## Key Stats:
- **Claim Speed Benchmark:** Under 80ms from ticket message to claim (avg).
- **Bot Uptime:** 24/7 stable operation.
- **Win Rate (vs competitor bots):** 94% success in test runs.
- **System Resource Usage:** < 50MB RAM, CPU under 1%.

## Payment & Fairness Policy:
This bot is built with a focus on speed, reliability, and fair-play competition. Ideal for those in high-demand ticket claiming environments on Revolt where microseconds make the difference.

We offer a **$100** reward for creating a bot that is as fast as or faster than existing competitor bots. Payment will be made **only** if the bot achieves the desired speed. To ensure fair and secure transaction handling, we are open to using a **middleman** or an escrow service.
